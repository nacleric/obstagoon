## Obstagoon
A general purpose blog generator

## TODO:
- work on content.html

#### [Recently Finished]
- Copy sprite assets to build folder
    -Ideas: revamp sprite_dl. Instead of download to content folder download directly to build
    folder. Or giv the option to target of specific folder in the configs (nah this was dumb
    hardcode everything)
- img url should be included into PokemonData
- Better support for content generation (mainly posts) might need beautifulsoup
- Create a function that deletes Posts before build (might not need this)
- Fix templates when it hits 490 pixels width
- Fix titles in posts.html
- Make templates nicer (good enough but needs detail)
